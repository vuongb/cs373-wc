			<name>Doctors Without Borders</name>
			<kind>Secular humanitarian-aid NGO</kind>
			<description>Formed during the Nigerian Cival War of 1967 to 1970. A number of French doctors volunteered to work in hospitals and feeding centers. The doctors were attacked by the Nigerian army and witnessed innocent civilians
			being killed. The doctors critisized the Nigerian government and the Red Cross who was complicit with their behavior. They agreed a new organization was needed that would ignore government and religious boundaries and prioritize the aid of those in need.
			At the same time a second group called Secours Medical Francais (French Medical Relief) was providing aid to those affected by the 1970 Bhola cyclone. The leader of the group, Raymond Borel, had inteded to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disaters.
			On 20 December 1971, these two groups merged to form Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders).</description>
